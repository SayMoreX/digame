/* August 2020... so, this doesn't actually work, but I'm leaving it here in case I find more info that could make it work.
What I'm trying to do is to include main process compiling in the standard "yarn dev" run. I got that to happen,
but I think only in-memory, while  the actual run of electron is still using the main-bundle.js that is sitting on disk. */
