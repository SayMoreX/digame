// The selected item is preserved because we have a "key" attribute on the table.
// Here we need to scroll the selected item into view when we've come back from
// looking at something else, otherwise it can be selected but not visible.
// We then call this when the ReactTable issues a fetchdata event. Note that previously
// we did this on ComponentDidUpdate, and that helped for switching between folders
// (e.g. different sessions) but did not help when switching between the top level tabs
// (e.g. between Project and Sessions) because there are no props changes to trigger it,
// but when React-Table would become visible and redraw, it would fail to restore the
// scroll position.
// Doesn't appear to be a more elegant way: https://github.com/react-tools/react-table/issues/420
