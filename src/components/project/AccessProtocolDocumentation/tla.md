**Open**

Resources can be accessed immediately.

**Restricted**

Resources can be accessed by registered users which possibly (as in the case of DOBES) have to agree with a Code of Conduct.

**Protected**

In addition to the conditions that hold for restricted resources, protected resources can be accessed on request only.

The responsibles (usually the depositors) will examine the request and, if they grant access, they may do so for a specific use or limited amount of time, which may have to be agreed upon in a usage declaration.

**Closed**

Can be accessed only by the depositors (and, e.g., members of the respective speech community).
