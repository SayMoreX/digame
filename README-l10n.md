We are using Crowdin.com for crowdsourcing translation, and combination of [lingui](https://lingui.js.org/) and a simple lookup table to use those translations.

# Using Lingui in Code

Lingui is used for all the hard-coded UI elements. The idea is that you use macros which lingui can find, so it can put the in the string catalog:

```xml
<Trans>Description Documents</Trans>
```

or

```xml
<Trans id="project.DescriptionDocuments">Description Documents</Trans>
```

or

```ts
import { t } from "@lingui/macro";
t`A simple string using the t macro`;
```

```ts
t`Today is ${weather}`;
```

which will appear to the translator as "Today is {weather}". I.e., without the $. See [more examples](https://lingui.js.org/ref/macro.html#examples-of-js-macros)

or

```ts
{
  this.i18n._(
    "project.DescriptionDocuments",
    {},
    { defaults: "Description Documents" }
  );
}
```

This format uses our own wrapper. Note that you still have to include the comment part for the lingui scanner to find it.

```ts
{
  translateMessage(/*i18n*/ { id: "Today is {d}", values{d:"sunny"} });
}
```

# Steps to Syncing

## 1) Build the string catalog

`yarn lingui-extract` reads .linguirc to know what files to include. It creates `po` files.

## 2) Sync with Crowdin

`yarn crowdin:sync` will send everything and pull the translations from Crowdin. You will need an environment variable LAMETA_CROWDIN_TOKEN set to your crowdin token that has permission to do uploads.

## 3) Let lingui create its `messages.js` files

`yarn lingui-compile`

# Checking for new strings using pseudo localization

Under Help:Registration, make sure you are listed as a "Developer". Next, under View Menu, choose "pseudo". Things that go through lingui will show letters with lots of accents: https://i.imgur.com/Mc1dX8Y.png.

Strings in fields.json5 and genres.json do not (yet) go through lingui, and should show with the label with "âœ“" appended to the English name. If you still need to add the string somewhere, it should instead be prepended with "MISSING-". Meanwhile, the console log has messages that are formatted to easy pasting into excel columns (https://i.imgur.com/EsoUHyq.png).

# Non-code Lookups in CSV

Currently we have lingui v2, and it does not have a way of extracting strings from anything but code. Since our field names and choice lists aren't in code, it can't be used (yet... maybe in lingui v3). So for now we have CSV files `locale/fields.csv` with all the field names, and `locale/choices.csv` with things like genres, statuses, etc. These are currently manually uploaded to https://crowdin.com/project/saymorex and then downloaded with the columns filled in from translations.

# How to add a language

1. In Crowdin:settings:translations:Target Languages, add the language. That will make it available for translation.

1. To .linguirc, add the code to `locales`

1. `yarn lingui-extract` (note: this will fail if the program is running, including JEST. So in vscode ctrl-shift-p, "Jest: Stop Runner")

1. For each csv: a) add a column for the new language b) add the language to the scheme in crowdin.yml c) in Crowdin:Content, do a "change scheme" (NOT "update"!!!!) and choose your local copy of the csv. For the new column, choose the language.

More detail on adding the language to CSVs:
First, make sure you have the latest translations into your local files.

Now you have to add the new column. By hand, add a column to top row of locale/\*.csv, using the same name and casing as Crowdin uses. Then in Crowdin:Files select each of these csv files and choose "Change Scheme" & select your local file to upload. This will open a UI in that lets you identify the new language of the column.

DANGER: Crowdin "Change Scheme" can actually remove translations as well. So first pull in any new translations before adding new languages.
If you do loose translations, they will still by in Crowdin's Translation Memory. You can apply them one by one or use the "Pre-Translation" to use the lameta TM to fill them back in. This is scary becuase the Crowdin UI does not make it clear that it will NOT use the "global TM". I tested it on a test.csv file, to ensure that it only pre-translates from the lameta TM.

For some reason, for genres.csv, the "Change scheme" tool doesn't recognize the csv nature of this file. You have to open it in Libre Office, then save as, and you can get it to add the commas at the end of the last field.

Be sure that whatever you open with notices the UTF8 encoding! If necessary, vscode `Change File Encoding` will save and explit BOM for you.

1. When the language has enough strings translated an it's time to add the language to the program, download the files from crowdin, and in `localization.ts`, add the new language code, e.g.

   `const languages = ["en", "es", "fr", "xyz"];`

1. Finally, in the menu.ts, add the new language option.

# Problems

I have not found a way to get the default string out to the extracted files. I would expect

```
<Trans id="ProjectTab.OtherDocuments">Other Documents</Trans>
```

To put "Other Documents" in at least the English PO file, but no. So I can see no way that a Translator can actually translate. So for now all the ids are just the English. Sigh again...

"po" was the only format of lingui's three options that Crowdin could handle.

Using the CSV format with Crowdin is PAINFUL (see above on adding a language). I should have found a better way.
